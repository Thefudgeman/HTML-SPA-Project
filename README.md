My project is a dungeon rpg game where the player fights enemies to gain rewards and level up. The player can spend money earned from defeating enemies to buy items from the shop to 
help in combat or to use to upgrade thier equipment. The combat is turn-based and the player ust beat the boss monster on each floor to go to the next floor. The first floor will be 
differnt and have 3 enemies with no boss but all enemies must be defeated in order to open the door to the next floor.
